Shown are the four possible switching patterns obtained for a symmetric system when sweeping the magnetic field. The red line indicates sweeping of the magnetic field strength in the positive direction, and the blue line indicates sweeping in the negative direction. All results presented are for four square lattice layers of $40 \times 40$ spins each at $T = .15$. The anisotropy strength $K$ and the antiferromagnetic coupling $J_{AFM}$ are shown in the inset of the individual layer plots, where $J_{AFM}$ displayed on the plot for layer $i$ refers to the coupling between layers $i$ and $i+1$. \relax }}{2}}
